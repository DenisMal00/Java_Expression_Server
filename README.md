# MalasiDenis Server Project

## Overview

The MalasiDenis project is a Java server designed to process and solve mathematical expressions sent by clients. Utilizing a multi-threaded architecture to handle multiple requests simultaneously, the server offers efficient parallel processing of expressions. Each request is analyzed, computed, and the result is sent back to the client.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Manages multiple connections simultaneously for efficient request processing.
- **Mathematical Expression Analysis**: Supports various types of mathematical operations, including basic operations and some advanced functions.
- **Exception Handling**: Includes robust exception handling to address parsing errors, division by zero, and other computational errors.

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher
